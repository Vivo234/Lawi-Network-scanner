# Lawi-Network-scanner
This code uses the Scapy library to send an ARP request packet to all devices on the specified IP range. The response is then parsed to extract the IP and MAC addresses of devices on the network. Finally, the list of clients is printed to the console.

To run the Python code snippet for the network scanner in a Linux environment, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal window in your Linux environment.

Install the Scapy library by running the following command:


pip install scapy

This will install the Scapy library and its dependencies.

Copy and paste the code snippet into a file called network_scanner.py.

Run the file using the following command:


python network_scanner.py

This will execute the Python script and display the list of devices on the network in the terminal window.

Note that the target_ip variable in the code should be set to the IP range you want to scan. You can modify this variable to scan a different IP range if needed.

Also, as mentioned earlier, it is important to ensure that you have proper authorization and permission to scan a network before doing so.
